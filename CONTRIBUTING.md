# Contributing

Read the GitHub guide to [forking projects and making pull requests](https://guides.github.com/activities/forking/).

## Contributing to an Existing Pull Request
If someone has made a pull request and you would like to add code to their branch, there are a number of ways to move forward.
It will be very helpful to get familiar with [managing remotes](https://help.github.com/en/github/using-git/about-remote-repositories) in Git.

First, ping them in the #admin-ui channel on [Drupal Slack](https://www.drupal.org/slack) to discuss the addition/changes
Once agreed, you can make a pull request to their fork/branch, which once accepted will appear in the pull request to this repo

Alternatively, they could give you access to modify their branch directly at https://github.com/<username>/admin_ui/settings/collaboration (although bear in mind this will give access to their entire repository fork)

If you're unable to agree, or unable to get in touch with the author, you can create a new pull request that incorporates the work from their branch.
Leave a comment in the old pull request linking to the new one.
